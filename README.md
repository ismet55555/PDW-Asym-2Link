## :thumbsup: Compatibility
This logger was created and tested on MATLAB R2017b and R2018b on a Windows 10 operating system. Although this logger was created within those software versions and operating systems, it may work in other environments as well.

I would love to hear about usage on earlier or later MATLAB versions and other operating systems.
